# The Plain Biegel (Bagel)

### where it all begins.

The building blocks of every great empire always starts with the basics. And so to does a great beigel. This recipe is intended to be the base in which other's can build upon in order to create their own great beigel recipes.

### Ingredients
#### makes 8 beigels

- **2 tsp Active dry yeast**
- **1 ½ Tbs Caster suger**
- **1 ¼ Cups (300ml) Warm water**
- **3 ½ Cups (500g) High grade/Bread flour**
- **1 ½ tps Salt**

#### Additional toppings
- Egg wash (1 egg whisked in a bowl)
- poppy seeds
- seseam seeds
- Sunflower seeds
- Sea salt flakes
- Minced garlic
- Mince onion

### Method

1. Combind the *caster suger* and *active dry yeast* with *½ cup (120ml) of the warm water*. Do not stir. Let it sit for 5 minutes before stiring. Stir mixture until the yeast and suger dissolve in the water.
2. In a large bowl combind the *high grade/bread flour* with the *salt*. Once combind create a well in the middel and pour in the *suger yeast mixture* as well as an addition *1/3 cup (90ml) of warm water*.
3. With a fork or hands mix and stir to create the dough. While mixing add the remaining *warm water* as needed. Depending on where you live you may need to add up to *¼ cup (60ml) of warm water*. You want to end up with a moist firm dough at the end.
4. on a large floured surface (countertop etc.), knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. try to work in as much flour as possible to form a firm stiff dough.
5. Lightly coat a large bowl with olive oil. place the dough in the bowl and roll it around to coat the surface. Cover with a damp tea towel (dish towel) and leave it in a warm place to rise for about 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size. Once doubled in size punch down the dough and let it rest for a further 10 minutes.
6. Carefully devide the dough into 8 equal pieces. shape each piece into a round. take each rounded piece of dough and press it gently against you work surface/countertop moving your hand and the dough in a circular motion, pulling the dough in on itself. While doing this slowly release the pressure on the top of the dough until a perfect dough ball forms.
7. dust you hands with flour. Take one finger and gentle press it into the center of a dough ball to form a ring. Stretch the ring to about 1/3 the diameter of the beigel and place on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough balls.
8. After forming all the dough balls into rings and placing them on a baking sheet, cover with you damp tea towel/dish towel and let them rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the over to 425°F/220°C/Gas 7.
9. Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Reduce the heat. Using a skiimer or slotted spoon place the beigels in the pot. The dough will expand slightly as it boils so keep that in mind when desiding how many to boil at once. let the beigel sit for 1 to 2 mintues (2 mintues for a chewier New York style beigel) then flip and let sit for a further 1 to 2 minutes.
10. If you want to add toppings to your beigels, or a crisper top, now is the time for that. Remove the bagels from the pot. Using a brush coat the tops of the beigels with your egg wash. This will hold the topping to the beigel as well as create a crisper surface on top of the beigel. Once the egg wash has been applied sprinkle on your topping or leave for a crisper topped plain beigel.
11. On a baking tray place a sheet of baking paper. Combind flour and cornmeal and coat the baking paper. Trasfer the beigels on to the baking paper and place in the oven.
12. Bake for 20 minutes at 425°F/220°C/Gas 7, until golden brown.
13. Remove and transfer the biegels to a cooling rack.
