# The Open source Beigel

The intention of this project is to create a repository of freely available, open source recipes for biegels. these recipes are for people to share with others and hopefully contribute to as well.

I have started by pushing the first recipe for a [plain beigel](https://github.com/opensourcebeigel/opensourcebeigel/blob/master/Recipes/plain.md) and hope to build upon that to make even more fantastic recipes in then ear future.
